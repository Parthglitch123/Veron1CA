## Introduction
Veron1CA is a Discord bot that is designed to be the combo of a moderation and a music bot and, at the same time, aims to deliver one of the most unified feels in case of command usage out there. Here are a few things that come out of the box:

- Almost every necessary moderation command with some alien ones as well.
- Continuously updating codebase with regular maintenance.
- Built with modern, asynchronous Python syntax.

Now, there isn't much spoiler about the initial features  about the bot here because it'll be better if you wanna learn and use it on your own.
