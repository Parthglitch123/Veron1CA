## Features
Veron1CA is designed to be the collab of a Discord moderation bot and a chill music bot. It mainly focuses on next level server moderation, which can make customizing and controlling Discord servers a breeze! Here are a few things that come with it under the hood:

- Almost every necessary moderation command with some alien ones as well.
- Continuously updating codebase with regular maintenance.
- Built with modern, organized Python syntax.
