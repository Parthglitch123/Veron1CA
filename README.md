## Getting to know...
Now this is where things get interesting.

Veron1CA is designed to be the collab of a Discord moderation bot and a chill music bot. It mainly focuses on next level server moderation, which can make customizing and controlling Discord servers a breeze! It's source is open as well, which means anybody can contribute to it if they spot a nasty bug in the code. We would like you to explore the powers of Veron1CA by yourself, as there's a lot of stuff out there waiting! A complete documentation on Veron1CA is under work-in-progress (BETA) so that you can have a more detailed view on itself.

As mentioned in an earlier statement, Veron1CA is open source, and if you feel like submitting your own ideas and improving the codebase, you can do that in the form of a pull request! We will check what you've done and maybe it will get added if it's good enough!
