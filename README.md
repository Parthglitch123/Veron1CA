## Getting to know...
Veron1CA is designed to be the collab of a Discord moderation bot and a chill music bot. It mainly focuses on next level server moderation, which can make customizing and controlling Discord servers a breeze! It's source is open as well, which means anybody can contribute to it if they spot a nasty bug in the code. We would like you to explore the powers of Veron1CA by yourself, as there's a lot of stuff out there waiting! A complete documentation of the project is under work-in-progress so that you can have a more detailed view on itself.

## Self-hosting Veron1CA
